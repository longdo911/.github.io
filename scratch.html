            Here is a game I made! Totoro
        </h1>
        <h4>
            Totoro is the title character in the Japanese animated film by Studio Ghibli 'My Neighbor Totoro'. He is a fuzzy, giant, furry, pointy-eared creature with wide eyes and a fantastic smile. In this game, totoro is trapped inside a box and controlled by an evil spirit and trying to kill you! There are three bosses: mini totoro, medium totoro and totoro, and the challenge of this game is to dodge every single projectile the boss shoots at you, as a cat bus, until he gets out of energy and fades away! GLHF~

            Questions for the game!
        </h1>
        <h4>
            <br>1.Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.
            <br>Some programming concepts or structures I learned in this unit that I applied in my game is the jumping motion, without this knowledge, our dodging game would be impossible to make.
            <br>2. Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?
            <br>I do have some problems with the double jump motion, to encounter this I do research and mostly looking up on youtube.
            <br>3.What aspects of your game do you like best?
            <br>The cat bus is able to double jump, walking in mid air and the bosses can shoot projectiles out randomly.
            <br>4.If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?
            <br> I would improve the scoring system and the graphics of the game.
